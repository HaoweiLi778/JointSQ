# Overview
  We propose Joint Sparsification Quantization (JointSQ), to address suboptimal solutions in communication-efficient distributed learning. Our approach unifies sparsification and quantization by treating sparsification as 0-bit quantization. JointSQ involves mixed-bit precision quantization for end-to-end compression. To adaptively assign bit-widths, we introduce a specially designed Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP) per layer with minimal computational cost.
