 Figure 1. Existing Co-compression methods and our JointSQ framework. Existing Co-compression methods typically apply sparsification and quantization step by step. Our framework considers sparsification as 0-bit quantization and thus the two-stage process is transformed into a unified learning framework.<br/><br/>
